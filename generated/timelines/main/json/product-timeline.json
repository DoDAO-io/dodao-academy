      "content": "Uniswap, the leading decentralized crypto exchange, will deploy to Binance's BNB blockchain using the Wormhole bridge after receiving 66% of votes in favor from Uniswap DAO members. The decision followed a political battle that saw the project's biggest investor, Andreesen Horowitz (a16z), lose out after advocating for its portfolio company, LayerZero, to be used as the cross-chain bridge. A16z raised security concerns about Wormhole in a community forum post but failed to block the vote, which has raised questions about the venture firm's influence within Uniswap's governance system.",
